# AI-Calculator
Letâ€™s play around with a basic artificially intelligent calculator.

## Features
This is how the application works:

It takes in inputs as text
Translates them into mathematical notation
Returns the answers in the numerical form
Please do not get overwhelmed by the gibberish in the code; we will look at it later in the activity. For now, run the AI calculator and play around with it. See if you can find the correct answers to your questions.

## Commands 
Use the following keywords for their associated operations:

- plus for addition
- minus for subtraction
- times for multiplication
- divided by for division
## Sample input 
You can start using the AI calculator with the following sample commands:

```
